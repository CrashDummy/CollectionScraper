# CollectionScraper
Web Scraper card collection site (https://fftcg.square-enix-games.com/na/card-browser)

This script scrapes and stores all the card information on a file. 

## Pre-requistutus
ChromeDriver is required to be installed for this script to work. 
It can be found at:
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads


## Usage Notes
1.  Update variable "driverpath" to the directory where the chromedriver is installed on your system
2.  Set headless=True meaning the chromedriver will run in the background, set to False if you wish to see selemium in action. 
3.  Run the fftcg.py script, get a coffee or tea (it usually takes 10mins).
4.  The result will be a csv file at the same directory.
